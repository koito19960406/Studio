# Studio

This repo includes my work done for studio.
My aim was to analyze the influence of Minatomirai's waterfront development on the demography.

Following contents are included:
1. Yokohama's demographic analysis
2. Changes in tourists

1. Yokohama's demographic analysis
  * I visualized the changes in the population in the three districts near Minatomirai. You can see that population increased after 2000, when waterfront development started.
